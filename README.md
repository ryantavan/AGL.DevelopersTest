# DevelopersTest

Dear Reviewer,
This application was a simple but good example of how to treat a collection of object as a third party data consumption.
It could be more modular and also I did spend more time to add exeption handeling as I was thinking dealing with data services has been 
a main purpose of this test.
Regards,
Ryan
