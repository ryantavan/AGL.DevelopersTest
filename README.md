# DevelopersTest

Dear Reviewer,
This application was a simple but good example of how to treat a collection of objects as a third party provided data.
It could be more modular and also I did not spend more time to add exception handling as I was thinking the way I would deal with data services has been 
a main purpose of this test.
Regards,
Ryan
